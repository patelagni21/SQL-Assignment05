1)  Let R=ABCDEGHK and F= {ABK→C, A→DG, B→K, K→ADH, H→GE} . 
Is it in BCNF?  Prove your answer.
R=ABCDEGHK is not in BCNF. This is because not all parts of the function fulfill the attributes needed. ABK->C and A->DG are not in BCNF while B->K is in BCNF. The last two are also not in BCNF which leads to my conclusion.



2)  Let R(ABCDEFG) be a relation and F={A -> C, A-> D,  B->F, E->F, F->G}

a. Show example of lossless join decomposition of R into three tables R1, R2 
and R3 and demonstrate that this decomposition is lossless using chase 
algorithm
R1(A-C,A-D,E-F) R2(B-F,F-G,E-F) R3(E-F)
Since all the properties are met, it is lossless decomposition.

b. Find one key for this scheme and prove that it is a key using closure 
algorithm and definition of a key.
The definition of a key is a single column or attribute (or group of columns) that can uniquely identify rows.
A key for this scheme is ABE since
A: A-C-D
B: B-F
E: E-F-G
Which makes A B E the key for this.

3)  Consider R = ABCDEG, with the set of dependencies F={AB → D, AB → C, 
AC → E, B → D, BE → A, E → G}. Suppose we have decomposed it into 
relations with set of attributes R1={ABD}, R2={ACE}, R3={ADEG}. Show using 
chase algorithm if this decomposition has lossless join property.
      A   B   C   D   E  G
 
 1    A   B   B1  D   E1 G1

 2    A   B2  C   D2  E  G2

 3    A   B3  B3  D   E  G
The E relations agree, which means we must see if the G values agree.
      A   B   C   D   E  G
 
 1    A   B   C1  D   E1 G1

 2    A   B2  C   D2  E  G

 3    A   B3  C3  D   E  G
None of these fulfill all the properties of R. After using the chase algorithm, I have found that this decomposition does not have lossless join property.



4)  Let R(ABCD)  be a relation and  F={A->B, C->D, BC->A}.   Apply chase 
algorithm to test if decomposition of R onto R1(AB), R2(AC), R3(BCD)  is 
lossless.
      A   B   C   D
 
 1    A   B   C1  D1

 2    A   B1  C   D1

 3    A3  B   C   D
We change B1 to B
      A   B   C   D
 
 1    A   B   C   D1

 2    A3  B   C   D1

 3    A3  B   C   D
D1 to D
      A   B   C   D
 
 1    A   B   C1  D1

 2    A   B   C   D

 3    A3  B   C   D
A3 to A
      A   B   C   D
 
 1    A   B   C1  D1

 2    A   B   C   D

 3    A   B   C   D
As we can see, all the properties of R(ABCD) have been fulfilled which means the decomposition of R onto R1... is lossless.

5) Let R(ABCDE)  be a relation and  F={AB, BCE, and ED A}. Decompose 
R into BCNF using BCNF decomposition algorithm. Remember that you need to 
compute projections of F to check if the decomposed tables are in BCNF.
R(AB) R2(DCE) R3 (EDA)
F1(A-B) F2(BC-E) F3(ED-A)

                           R(ABCDE)
                      /       |       \
                  R1(AB)   R2(BCE)   R3(EDA)
                    /         |         \
                F1(A->B)   F2(BC->E)   F3(ED->A)

6) Let  R(ABCDEFGH) be a relation and F= {ABE, CD, DE, FGA}. 
Decompose R in BCNF using BCNF decomposition algorithm. Remember that 
you need to compute projections of F to check if the decomposed tables are in 
BCNF.   Using Chase algorithm demonstrate if the decomposition you obtained is 
in fact lossless. 

AB-E 
R1(ABE)
R2(ABCDFGH)

C-D 
R3(CD)
R2(ABCDFGH) - (D)
R4(ABCFHG)

D-E 
R4(ABCFHG) - (E)
R4(ABCFGH)
R5(DE)

FG-A
R4(ABCFGH) - (A)
R7(BCFGH)
R6(FGA)
FG-A

After creating the table, it is evident that properties of R(ABCDEFGH) have been fulfilled which means the decomposition is lossless.
